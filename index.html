				My Name is Heidy Palacios. I am a soon to be 40-year-old that decided to make a big change in my life. I always liked designing and creating things and combining technology into it is even more appealing to me. Since I was in my 20s I always liked creating videos and editing them, I find the whole process rewarding and that led me to be curious about building websites and/or editing them. </p>
				<br>
				<p>As I got older my interest grew but my circumstances did not allow me to peruse my curiosity when I was younger due to family responsibilities. This will be a difficult journey but one that I look forward to embarking on and learn as much as I can through my journey. I look forward to the challenges as they can only help me get better.
